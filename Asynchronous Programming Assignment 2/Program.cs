          Requirments: 
           1. You need to build classes that represent the router and route.
           2. You need to build a class that reads input from user to:
              a.Create a new route.
              b.Add a router to given route.
           3. Create a class that contains two methods.
              a.Sync method that calculates best route from available routes.
              b.Async method that calculates best route asynchronously by calculating total time required for each route in a separate thread.
           4. The number of routes for each route is dynamic depending on user input.
           5. The max number of allowed parallel threads is 4, for instance if we have 3 routes only, then you need to run 3 threads only 
              but if you have more than for 4 like 6, first you run 4 threads and once a thread is released you need to run one more and so on.
